### Install

To get started with coding, you need [node](http://nodejs.org), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) and some skills in web technologies. 

```
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run the app
yarn start
```

*Note:* If you are on Linux install the `libsecret` library first ([see here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keytar#on-linux)).


### Package application

Generate executables for Windows, MacOS and Linux is as easy as this:

```
# Package the application
yarn dist
```

Afterwards you find the binaries within the `dist/` folder.
